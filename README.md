![screenshot](./public/radio.png)

Radio Widget is a React Based Widget that manages radio stations. It is mostly static but can be very dynamic once connected to an Api endpoint and data is passed to the `StationBody` component using the `stations` props. Api calls can be made in the `getStations` and `toggleStation` actions using redux. The Radio widget is accessibility compliant.
